        <h2>11/28/2022 - Assignment 5 Published</a></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. 
                How did you solve those problems?
            </li>
            <p>
                This assignment was definitely difficult for me in that some parts just did not click and I did not
                have the time to learn them. Those were the adding a post with templeates, which altered everything else,
                and printing a single page, which simply didn't work no matter what I did.
            </p>
            <li>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? 
                What did you find that you already knew?
            </li>
            <p>
                This assignment taught me how to use handlebars. I already knew some of it from the in class lectures but
                other than that I was learning more on the things to pass to handlebar templates.
            </p>
            <li>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? 
                The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?
            </li>
            <p>
                The most helpful resource by far was the in class demo of handlebars.
            </p>
            <li>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</li>
            <p>
                I had to google how to turn a string to an int.
